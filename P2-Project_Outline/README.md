# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
A catalogue of video games, where users can create a profile and add games to their profile. Users can make an account, and then add games to either an owned, wish, or custom list. Users will be able to rate games they own, and the average score will be displayed with the game in the list. Ideally will be able to pull game information from SteamAPI in order to have a large catalogue of available games, but if not then users will be able to add games to the database manually.

### Features
User account: Users will be able to create an account and will have an associated profile.
User profiles: Users will have a profile that shows the lists they have created and be able to set a profile picture.
Add to list: Users will be able to add games to their own 'owned' list or wishlist.
Search/List: Users will be able to search for a specific game or list all games in the database.
Rating: Users will be able to rate games that they own in either a 1-10 scale or recommend/not recommend scale. Ratings will be calculated into an average that will appear in the game's info.
SteamAPI Integration: (Ideally) will be able to pull game information from the Steam database in order to populate available games.
Add games to database: If above is too difficult or time-intensive, users will be able to add games to the database themselves.
